## Introduction

3D driving simulators are essential tools for autonomous driving research. However, their reliability is often overlooked.  
Our project systematically evaluates simulator reliability and exposes several critical bugs.

## Key Findings

- **20 distinct simulator bugs** found across three major simulators.
- **Critical failures** include collisions, off-road events, agent stuck, and trajectory deviations.
- Some bugs have been **confirmed by original developers**.
- Certain errors **do not occur in matched real-world experiments**, showing risk of misleading ADS evaluation.

## Detailed Results

### Real World Experiment
To verify whether the bugs found in simulation also occur in real-world settings, we set up a sand table that exactly replicates the simulated map. Both the virtual and real vehicles are controlled by the Apollo system, using the same commands generated in the simulation. 
As shown in the video, the virtual vehicle in CARLA deviates significantly from its planned path. However, the real vehicle on the sand table, following the same commands, stays on the planned path without any deviation. This demonstrates that the bug observed in simulation does not actually occur in the real world, and is a false positive caused by the simulator. Such differences highlight the importance of double-checking simulation results with real-world experiments.
